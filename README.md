### Data Validation & Cleaning
-Ensuring Consistency in Data Types: I validated that each column contained only a single datatype, ensuring uniformity and accuracy across the dataset.
-I used the filter icon to identify blank spaces and inconsistencies in rows. I deleted the null values from the datasets.
-Removing Unnecessary Characters: I used the "Replace" function to eliminate unwanted characters, such as quotation marks, that could interfere with the analysis.
-Dropping Irrelevant Columns: I identified and removed columns that were not essential for the analysis, such as the UserID column, to enhance focus and reduce noise.
-Renaming Columns for Clarity: To improve the datasetâ€™s readability and interpretability:
-Renamed Categories and types in the Content Table to Content Categories and Content type.
-Renamed Scores in the Reaction Type Table to Reaction Scores.
-Renamed type from Reactions Table to Reaction Types.
